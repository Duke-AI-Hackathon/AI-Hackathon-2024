# Duke Generative AI Hackathon 2024

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **2024 Duke Generative AI Hackathon**! 

We’re excited to have you join us!. 

This README will give you an overview of the hackathon and provide essential resources to help you get started with some basic tools before the event.

## About the Hackathon

This hackathon is designed to encourage creativity and collaboration in the generative AI space. Whether you're new to AI or have experience, our aim is to create an inclusive environment where participants can bring their ideas to life. 

For more information about the hackathon, check out our [official website](https://duke-ai-hack.webflow.io/).

## Repository Structure

Here’s a quick guide to what’s inside this repository:

- **`/tutorials`**  
  This folder contains scripts and notebooks for crucial concepts you'll need to bring your ideas to life during the hack!

    - **`/nlp`**  
    Here, you’ll find links to beginner resources, tutorials, and documentation for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This section is particularly helpful if you’re new to NLP or need a refresher on basic Natural Language tasks.

    - **`/llm`**  
    This folder includes example code for simple generative AI applications. This focuses particularly on Large Language Models and certain stratgeies to get the best results through Prompt Engineering. 

        - **`/chatbot`**
    This final folder contains code for a basic Streamlit app for LLM-based chatbots. This folder showcases applications of what you just learnt from the `llm` folder and also serves as an example of Streamlit application.
